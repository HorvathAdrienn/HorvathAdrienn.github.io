                <h2>About the author</h2>
                <p>This site's author is Horváth Adrienn Mária, a <b>webdeveloper and UX designer</b> who lives at Hungary. Being a webdeveloper and designer means so much to her, that she has always thought it is very creative. You have to be really flexible
                    to solve problems through coding.
                </p>
                <p>Adrienn was 13 years old when started her first website. The idea was a game where you could raise horses. It has been solved by random pictures beautifully aligned, with needs like food or water. It used eoldal.hu as <b>hosting page</b>.
                    Later took a 180 degrees turn and made another website with gportal.hu. The author realized that writing is a beautiful art and wanted to create a place to share her ideas. CSS designs have been used, and by seeing how the website
                    changes, Adrienn knew what path to take.</p>
                <p>Attended to BKSZC Pogány Frigyes Szakgimnázium in 2013, finished it as <b>computer system administrator</b>. Then took another two years learning as a software-developer. Softwares did not entertain her, but still has seen something in
                    webdevelopment. So mainly <b>self-taught</b> the author has begun her road, created multiplie projects and is dedicated to learn something new everyday.</p>
